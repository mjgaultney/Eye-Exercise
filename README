This project was to make a pair of eyes that will follow the curser of our mouse around the webpage screen. 
To operate the project you do not need to do much more than move the mouse around and watch the madhatter (cat) eyes follow your “mouse” around. 
Cats eat mice so it will stay fixated on the curser as if it is the real thing. 
I decided to make the eyes cat like and change the background to make the project a little more fun for the user. 
Eventually, I would like to make the curser turn into a small rodent and add more features to the cat, like ears or a cat tail waiving in the background.
